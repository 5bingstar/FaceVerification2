# Boosted multi-task learning for face verification 
This is an implementation of [Boosted multi-task learning for face verification with applications to web image and video search](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206736/?reload=true) in C++. The repository implemented Boosted Multi-Task Learning algorithm for face cerification task and did some experiments for the evaluation.

Includes:
* LBP(Local Binary Pattern)  Features Extraction
* Adaboost Learning with LBP features
* Boosted Multi-Task Learning

## LBP Features Extraction
* LBP Feature (Radius = 2, Points = 8)
